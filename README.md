# Sentiment-Analysis-Deep-Learning-Project-Phase-2
In phase 2 of our multi-modal sentiment analysis project, we will be focusing on the text-based sentiment analysis section. This phase is critical as it will help us understand the underlying emotions and feelings in the user's textual data.

To accomplish this task, we will start by constructing a tf-idf vector representation for each piece of textual data. This method will help us identify the importance of each word in the document based on their frequency and relevance to the document. We will also generate vectors similar to word2vec, which will help us identify the context of the words within the text.

Next, we will explore pre-prepared representation vectors such as GloVe, FastText, and other embeddings to improve our model's accuracy. These pre-trained models have been trained on large corpuses and can help us identify the underlying sentiment in the text.

We will also use BERT's pre-trained model using transfer learning in NLP to analyze the sentiment of the textual data. BERT is a powerful deep learning model that has shown impressive results in natural language processing tasks such as language translation and sentiment analysis.

Once we implement all these methods, we will evaluate and compare their performance to determine the most effective approach. We will analyze the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of each technique to select the best one for our multi-modal sentiment analysis system.

In conclusion, phase 2 of our project focuses on implementing various techniques for sentiment analysis from textual data. By utilizing different approaches and evaluating their performance, we aim to develop a robust and accurate multi-modal sentiment analysis system.
